# The Visulization of Named Entity Recognition
This project is one of the Natural Language Processing Visulization projects of IRLAB,WUHAN UNIVERSITY.<br> 
It has only implemented one pretty simple funciton：type one or several Chinese sentences in the website, post it(by clicking the button named "命名实体识别"), and the backend programs will return the PERs(PERSONs),LOCs(LOCATIONs) and ORGs(ORGANIZATIONs) included in those Chinese sentences.

You may use it by the following steps
---------
1. run NER.py,<br>
2. open test.html.<br>

`This is just a demo of the project and is waiting to be updated.`
